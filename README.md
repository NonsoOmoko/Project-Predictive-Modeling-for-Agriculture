# Project-Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture
Harness the power of machine learning to help farmers optimize their crop selection. This project predicts the best crop type based on soil metrics like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value. Using logistic regression models, we identify the most predictive soil feature to maximize crop yield efficiently.
